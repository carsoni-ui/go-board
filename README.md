# Go Board Java Project

## Overview

This project is a Java-based implementation of a Go board, which includes key functionalities such as placing stones, detecting captures, and scoring based on traditional Go game rules. It was developed as a part of a class assignment to practice data structures, algorithms, and recursion in Java.

## Features

- **Player Turns**: Allows alternating turns for black and white stones.
- **Capture Detection**: Implements capture rules to detect when stones are captured by the opponent.
- **Score Calculation**: Calculates the score based on the number of stones captured.
- **Error Handling**: Includes bounds checking and validation of moves.
- **Recursive Capture Logic**: Uses recursion for detecting and managing captures.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher
- **Git** (for cloning and version control)
